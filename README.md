# Messenger Chat Analysis with Python and Pandas

## About this project

This project was born out of curiosity and a desire to explore one of my group chats. It also serves as one of my first venture into the field of <b>Data Science</b>. The goal of this project is to analyze Messenger group chats (or DMs) and uncover insights. Through a variety of visualizations it presents message volumes, reaction and word counts, participant activity levels and identifys the most active members of the group chat.
